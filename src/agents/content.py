- Vary paragraph length for natural rhythm

STORY STRUCTURE (organic flow):
- Start with a moment, feeling, or observation

- Connect it to something broader that others might relate to

NATURAL LANGUAGE RHYTHM:
- Mix long and short sentences for natural speech patterns

Create a blog article that someone would willingly read to the end because they're genuinely interested in learning about the topic from someone who clearly knows what they're talking about.
